# because steam is broken with older nvidia driver
# Apparantly the moment you boot the vgpu-patched driver the i686 OpenGL stack that Steam downloads is forced to use the NVIDIA 32-bit userspace libraries that come with that driver.
# Those libraries are not part of the normal NixOS closure â€“ they are copied in by the Steam runtime helper and they do not get rebuilt when you update util-linux. Consequently they still carry the old DT_NEEDED tag MOUNT_2_39, while the glib2 that is already in the runtime (built against a newer util-linux) expects MOUNT_2_40

Sometime before 2020, I decided to try to make a Minecraft server, young and naive, I followed a tutorial that used Linux and installed it on the spare computer I was setting up, thus kickstarting my Linux journey with Debian.
The good old days when I would use the root account as my main graphical account, making a mess of a system in every sense of the word.

I have tried many Linux distributions: Debian, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, PopOS, Linux Mint, Peppermint OS, Manjaro, Garuda Linux, Raspberry Pi OS... many systems have been messed up, misconfigured, or even destroyed at a whim... before NixOS.

I stuck with Linux hoping for better performance for my [blender animations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg46PWHsHHxSWg2LUujk1Zg), but saw the value in the open-source ideals and the ability to fully control my system. But one of my objectives was to automate my configuration and workflow, that's why this is one of my first repositories, initially with the name [Linux Config](https://github.com/Yeshey/nixOS-Config/tree/c0d1ba901bf9783b82ef876ddd54c0cac8ab6c3e). But only much later would I find nixOS to achieve that goal.

## University and Programming

I had the displeasure of experiencing COVID in my first years of university which gave me the opportunity to hone my familiarity with Linux, I was introduced to functional programming and nix by [Kylix](https://github.com/kylixafonso), and since then I've been fascinated by the technologies.
I believe a system like nixOS has the potential to be the most user-friendly in the Linux ecosystem, and I'd love to see it flourish.
